R. Holley and T. M. Liggett, Ann. Probab. 3, 643 (1975). **Ergodic Theorems for Weakly Interacting Infinite Systems and the Voter Model** 

**Abstract**
A theorem exhibiting the duality between certain infinite systems of interacting stochastic processes and a type of branching processes is proved. This duality is then used to study the ergodic properties of the infinite system. In the case of the vector model a complete understanding of the ergodic behavior is obtained.

**Def. 'Voter Model'**
The term "voter model" will be used to describe the continuous time proximity process in which the sets $N_{i,k}$ are singeltons for $k \geq 1$, which we may as well take to be distinct for each $i$, and $f_{i}(0) = 0$ for all $i \in I$. The interpretation of the process which leads to this terminology is that the $i$th individual periodically reevaluates his position or some issue (the two possible positions on the issue are denoted by 0 and 1), and at each time of reevaluation, he chooses to espouse position 1 with probability $\sum f_i (k)$, where the sum is taken over those $k$ for which the individual $N_{i,k}$ favors position 1. The fact that $N_{i,k}={i} for some $k$ is possible permit the individual to let his own previous choice affect his future choice.
