Mobilia, M. **Does a Single Zealot Affect an Infinite Group of Voters?** _Phys. Rev. Lett._ **91**, 028701 (2003).

**Abstract**
A method for studying the exact properties of a class of inhomogeneous stochastic many-body systems is developed and presented in the framework of a voter model perturbed by the presence of a ‘‘zealot,’’ an individual allowed to favor an ‘‘opinion.’’ We compute exactly the magnetization of this model and find that in one (1D) and two dimensions (2D) it evolves, algebraically (~ t^(-1/2)) in 1D and much slower (~1/ ln(t)) in 2D, towards the unanimity state chosen by the zealot. In higher dimensions the stationary magnetization is no longer uniform: the zealot cannot influence all the individuals. The implications to other physical problems are also pointed out.
